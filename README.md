# Real-Spike
This repository contains the codes for the ECCV2022 paper "Real Spike: Learning Real-valued Spikes for Spiking Neural Networks"


We provide a ResNet18 checkpoint for you to verify on ImageNet. 

We realize our code based on Spike-Element-Wise-ResNet, which can be found at: https://github.com/fangwei123456/Spike-Element-Wise-ResNet.

Please download the "Spike-Element-Wise-ResNet" and replace corresponding file with ours provided and run the code as "Spike-Element-Wise-ResNet".
